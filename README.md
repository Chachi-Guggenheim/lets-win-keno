# lets-win-keno
Random number generator bounded by the # of spots available in Keno games. My suspicion is that "quick picks" placed through MA are registered to the state who in turn controls the number of jackpots won by those who select Quick Pick as an option. By utilizing LetsWinKeno, users can be confident the government is NOT working against them.
